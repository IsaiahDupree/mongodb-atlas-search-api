# MongoDB Atlas Search API Project - Requirements and Progress

**Date:** April 16, 2025  
**Project:** MongoDB Atlas Search API with Vector Search Capabilities

## Project Overview

This document outlines the client requirements for the MongoDB Atlas Search API project and tracks our progress towards meeting these objectives. The project involves creating a containerized search and ingest API for MongoDB Atlas with vector search capabilities, optimized for Norwegian and Swedish product data.

## Client Requirements and Progress

### Objective 1: Search and Ingest API for MongoDB Atlas Search
> Make a Search and ingest API in front of MongoDB Atlas Search with knnBeta enabled.

**Status: ✅ Completed**
- Implemented FastAPI-based API with MongoDB Atlas integration
- Configured MongoDB Atlas with knnBeta vector search capabilities
- Created ingestion endpoints for products data

**Implementation Details:**
- API structure follows RESTful principles with dedicated routers for different functionalities
- MongoDB connection and index management handled in the `database/mongodb.py` module
- Proper error handling and validation throughout the API

### Objective 2: Vector Search for E-commerce Products
> Be able to use vector search to search 10,000 products and return a faceted result set. The set will be used from an E-commerce search results page.

**Status: ✅ Completed**
- Implemented vector search functionality in the `/search` endpoint
- Added support for faceted search results
- Successfully tested with product dataset

**Implementation Details:**
- Vector search uses knnBeta operators in MongoDB Atlas
- Faceted results include filters for brand, price range, age buckets, colors, and seasons
- Response format optimized for e-commerce frontend integration

### Objective 3: Local Embeddings Generation
> The search and Ingest API should use a LOCAL(!) embeddings model to generate embeddings for product.title and product.description and store that in MongoDB along with the product documents.

**Status: ✅ Completed**
- Implemented local embeddings generation using `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` model
- Optimized for Norwegian and Swedish languages
- Embeddings stored in MongoDB alongside product data

**Implementation Details:**
- Used sentence-transformers for efficient local embedding generation
- Model loaded and cached for optimal performance
- Batched processing for large product sets

### Objective 4: Product Recommendations
> Able to ingest sales data being orderlines with the following info: [orderNr, ProductNr, CustomerNr, SeasonName, DateTime]. This data should be used to generate "Product recommendations like "Users who bought X also bought these products".

**Status: ✅ Completed**
- Implemented orderline ingestion endpoint
- Created product recommendation system based on customer purchase patterns
- Support for "Users who bought X also bought Y" recommendations

**Implementation Details:**
- Used a naive recommender system based on co-occurrence patterns
- Optimized MongoDB queries for recommendation generation
- Recommendations updated as new orderlines are ingested

### Objective 5: API Key Authorization
> Authorize access to API via a shared secret in request header value "x-apikey". Don't overengineer, just check if the value is correct as set in some project config file.

**Status: ✅ Completed**
- Implemented simple API key authorization using the "x-apikey" header
- API key configured in the project's environment variables
- All sensitive endpoints protected with API key verification

**Implementation Details:**
- Used FastAPI dependency injection for authorization checks
- Simple but effective security implementation
- Proper error handling for unauthorized requests

## Data Processing Progress

To support the project requirements, we've developed a comprehensive data processing pipeline:

### 1. Data Transformation
**Status: ✅ Completed**
- Created `transform_data.py` to convert source data (Omnium format) to the API's expected format
- Successfully processed all products from the sample dataset
- Implemented robust error handling for data inconsistencies

**Implementation Details:**
- Field mapping from source to target model
- Special handling for derived fields
- Support for batch processing

### 2. Data Validation
**Status: ✅ Completed**
- Developed `validate_data.py` to validate transformed data against the API schema
- Successfully validated all transformed products
- Generated detailed validation reports

**Implementation Details:**
- Schema-based validation with field type checking
- Constraint validation for field values
- Statistics on field coverage and data quality

### 3. Data Ingestion
**Status: ✅ Completed**
- Created `ingest_data.py` for loading transformed data into MongoDB Atlas
- Implemented batch processing for efficient ingestion
- Added robust error handling and retry logic

**Implementation Details:**
- Configurabe batch size for optimal performance
- Progress tracking during ingestion
- Verification of successful ingestion

### 4. Search Testing
**Status: ✅ Completed**
- Developed `test_search.py` for testing search functionality
- Added offline testing mode for validation without API connection
- Successfully tested various search queries against transformed data

**Implementation Details:**
- Comprehensive set of test queries covering different search scenarios
- Performance metrics for search operations
- Detailed test reports

## API Endpoints Implemented

As per the client requirements, the following endpoints have been implemented:

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|

| `/doc/{productid}` | GET | ✅ Complete | Retrieves full product document |
| `/health` | GET | ✅ Complete | Health check endpoint |
| `/query-explain` | POST | ✅ Complete | Debug endpoint for query interpretation |
| `/feedback` | POST | ✅ Complete | Logs user actions for query tuning |
| `/remove/product/{productid}` | DELETE | ✅ Complete | Removes a specific product |
| `/remove/products/all` | DELETE | ✅ Complete | Removes all products |

   - A/B testing framework for search algorithm improvements
   - Enhanced recommendation algorithms

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Additional stress testing with larger datasets
   - User acceptance testing with real search scenarios
   - Security penetration testing

## Conclusion

The MongoDB Atlas Search API project has successfully met all client requirements. We've implemented a robust, dockerized solution that provides advanced search and recommendation capabilities for e-commerce products in Norwegian and Swedish languages. The system is ready for production use with comprehensive documentation and testing.

The modular design allows for future extensions, and the codebase follows best practices for maintainability and scalability.
