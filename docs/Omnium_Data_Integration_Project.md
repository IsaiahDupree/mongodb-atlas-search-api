# Omnium Product Data Integration Project

**Date:** April 16, 2025  
**Project:** Integration of Omnium product data with MongoDB Atlas Search API

## Project Overview

This project involves processing and integrating product data from the Omnium data format into a MongoDB Atlas Search API. The goal is to enable advanced vector search capabilities for product catalog data, improving search relevance and user experience.

## Data Source

**File:** `Omnium_Search_Products_START-1742999880951.json`
- **Size:** ~6.2MB
- **Records:** 26,261 products
- **Format:** JSON with nested structure
- **Content:** Product information including IDs, names, descriptions, categories, prices, and properties

## Project Components

The project is organized into the following components:

### 1. Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created in the `docs/data_processing/` directory:

- **README.md**: Overview of the data processing workflow
- **01_data_overview.md**: Analysis of source and target data structures
- **02_data_transformation.md**: Data transformation process and mapping strategy
- **03_data_ingestion.md**: Process for ingesting data into MongoDB Atlas
- **04_validation_testing.md**: Methods for validating and testing the search functionality

### 2. Scripts

A set of Python scripts has been developed in the `scripts/data_processing/` directory:

- **transform_data.py**: Converts Omnium data format to MongoDB Atlas format
- **validate_data.py**: Validates transformed data against the target schema
- **ingest_data.py**: Loads transformed data into MongoDB Atlas
- **test_search.py**: Tests search functionality with various queries

### 3. Workflow Steps

The complete data integration workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Analysis**: Understanding the source data structure and target requirements
2. **Transformation**: Converting data to the format expected by the API
3. **Validation**: Ensuring data quality and schema compliance
4. **Ingestion**: Loading data into MongoDB Atlas
5. **Testing**: Verifying search functionality and performance

## Data Transformation Process

### Source to Target Mapping

The transformation process maps Omnium product data to the MongoDB Atlas product model:

| Target Field | Source Field | Transformation Logic |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| id | id | Direct mapping |
| title | name | Direct mapping |
| description | Generated | Combines name, category, and property information |
| brand | supplierName | Direct mapping or property extraction |
| priceOriginal | prices[].originalUnitPrice | Prioritizes B2C Norwegian prices |
| priceCurrent | prices[].unitPrice | Prioritizes B2C Norwegian prices |
| isOnSale | Calculated | True if priceOriginal > priceCurrent |
| ageFrom/ageTo | properties | Extracted from properties or product name |
| color | properties | Extracted from properties or product name |
| seasons | Derived | Determined from product name and categories |

### Extraction Methods

The transformation script uses several specialized extraction methods:

- **Property Extraction**: Retrieves values from the nested properties array
- **Brand Extraction**: Finds brand information from multiple possible sources
- **Price Extraction**: Selects appropriate prices from multiple market options
- **Age Range Extraction**: Parses age information using pattern matching
- **Season Determination**: Identifies seasonal products using keyword analysis

## Initial Testing Results

A sample of 10 products was successfully transformed and validated:

- **Source**: First 10 products from Omnium data
- **Validation**: All products passed schema validation
- **Field Coverage**: Key fields like ID, title, brand, and price were present in all products
- **Transformations**: Price, color, and season information was successfully extracted

## Next Steps

The following steps are ready to be executed:

1. **Full Data Transformation**:
   ```bash
   python scripts\data_processing\transform_data.py --input "Omnium_Search_Products_START-1742999880951\Omnium_Search_Products_START-1742999880951.json" --output "transformed_products.json"
   ```

2. **Full Data Validation**:
   ```bash
   python scripts\data_processing\validate_data.py --input "transformed_products.json" --report "validation_report.json"
   ```

3. **Data Ingestion** (requires API to be running):
   ```bash
   python scripts\data_processing\ingest_data.py --input "transformed_products.json" --api-url "http://localhost:8000" --api-key "your_default_api_key"
   ```

4. **Search Testing**:
   ```bash
   python scripts\data_processing\test_search.py --api-url "http://localhost:8000" --api-key "your_default_api_key" --output "search_results.json"
   ```

## Performance Considerations

When processing the full dataset of 26,261 products, be aware of these performance considerations:

- **Memory Usage**: The transformation process loads the entire source file into memory
- **Processing Time**: Full transformation may take several minutes
- **API Load**: Ingestion uses batching (default 100 products per request) to avoid overwhelming the API
- **Verifications**: Sample verification is performed to confirm successful ingestion

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

- **Memory Errors**: Use the `--limit` parameter to process a smaller subset of products
- **API Connection Failures**: Verify the API is running and the URL is correct
- **Authentication Errors**: Confirm the API key is valid
- **Data Validation Failures**: Check the validation report for details
- **Slow Ingestion**: Adjust the batch size to optimize performance

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Streaming Processing**: Modify the transformation script to process data in a streaming fashion
2. **Advanced Category Handling**: Implement more sophisticated category mapping
3. **Text Enhancement**: Use NLP to improve product descriptions
4. **Image Integration**: Add support for product images
5. **Search Optimization**: Fine-tune vector search parameters
6. **Multilingual Support**: Enhance handling of multiple languages (Norwegian, Swedish)

## Conclusion

This project provides a complete solution for integrating Omnium product data with MongoDB Atlas Search. The modular approach allows for flexibility in handling different data sources and search requirements. The documentation and scripts provide a solid foundation for ongoing data management and search functionality.
